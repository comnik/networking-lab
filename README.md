# Reliable Sliding-Window Transport Layer

As our first project for the Spring 2015 Networking & Operating Systems Course
at ETH we we're supposed to implement a reliable sliding-window implementation on top of UDP.

We didn't quite finish it.
Things remaining: Buffered ACKs, actually checking cheksums, maximum retries.
